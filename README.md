# Fedora Dotfiles

**Author:** Weston Preising

A minimal Fedora 43 i3 configuration focused on development (I'm currently an MS in CS candidate at Mines) and guitar practice/recording.
Emphasis on vim-based applications when possible since vim is fun. A profound thank you to all open source contributors—thank you for making Linux accessible and enjoyable :).

## To-do
